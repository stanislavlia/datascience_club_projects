Here's an improved version of the roadmap for your ETL project in Python, incorporating best practices and some additional steps to ensure a smooth workflow:

---

## Project Roadmap

### **Extract**

1) **Understand API Requirements**
   - Research the API that provides random users (e.g., Random User Generator API).
   - Ensure you understand rate limits, authentication requirements (if any), and response format.
   
2) **Learn API and HTTP Request Practices**
   - Explore best practices for making HTTP requests (e.g., retries, timeouts).
   - Understand concepts like rate limiting, error handling, and how to optimize request performance.

3) **Start with Python’s Requests Library**
   - Set up and install the `requests` library to interact with the API.
   - Test API calls using simple scripts to fetch user data.

4) **Fetch Single and Batch Users**
   - Write a Python function to fetch a single user from the API.
   - Extend the function to handle batches of users (e.g., 100 users in one request).

5) **Save Data to Local Storage**
   - Implement a function to store user data (batch or single) in a local file format (JSON, CSV, etc.).
   - Ensure that the file is written efficiently and handles potential errors.

6) **Create a CLI for the Extraction Script**
   - Use Python’s `argparse` to create a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to run the extraction script with parameters like batch size, file name, and API settings.

---

### **Transform**

7) **Understand the JSON Structure**
   - Examine the structure of the JSON data returned by the API.
   - Identify the fields required for analysis (e.g., name, location, email, etc.).

8) **Data Preprocessing & Enrichment**
   - Write a script to flatten nested JSON and preprocess fields.
   - Enrich data using external libraries like `geopy` for geolocation, `datetime` for date formatting, and others as needed (e.g., country code conversion).

9) **CLI for Data Transformation**
   - Extend the script with CLI options for running transformations. For instance, allow the input file and output file path to be specified via the command line.
   - Save the transformed data in a common format like CSV or parquet.

---

### **Load**

10) **Create a Supabase Account and Set Up Database**
    - Sign up for Supabase and create a new project.
    - Set up the necessary database in Supabase (PostgreSQL).

11) **Get PostgreSQL Connection String**
    - Obtain the connection string (pg_uri) from Supabase for the database.

12) **Install and Use pgAdmin**
    - Install `pgAdmin` to interact with your PostgreSQL database.
    - Create initial tables and run basic queries to understand the schema.

13) **Design Database Schema and Create Tables**
    - Design an optimized schema based on your transformed data.
    - Create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database, ensuring proper data types, constraints, and indexes.

14) **Write Data Load Script**
    - Write a Python script to read the transformed CSV or parquet files and load them into your PostgreSQL database using a library like `psycopg2` or `SQLAlchemy`.

---

### **Finalization**

15) **Makefile for Dependency and Task Management**
    - Write a `Makefile` to simplify running common tasks such as installing dependencies, running the ETL pipeline, and testing.
    - Define commands like `make extract`, `make transform`, `make load`, etc.

16) **Add Logging and Error Handling**
    - Add logging to all stages (extract, transform, load) using Python's `logging` library.
    - Implement error handling (e.g., for HTTP failures, I/O errors, and database connection issues).
    - Consider logging to external services like Datadog or using structured logging with JSON output.

17) **Package into Docker**
    - Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize the entire ETL pipeline.
    - Ensure all dependencies, environment variables, and configurations are captured in the Docker image.
    - Test the Docker container by running the ETL process inside it.

---

### **Additional Improvements**

18) **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**
    - Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., API calls, data transformation, database loading).
    - Use a library like `pytest` to create tests and run them as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

19) **CI/CD Pipeline**
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) to automate testing, building Docker images, and deploying to production.

20) **Scheduling ETL Pipeline**
    - Schedule your ETL pipeline to run at regular intervals using tools like `cron`, `Airflow`, or cloud-based scheduling services (e.g., AWS Lambda + CloudWatch).

21) **Scalability and Optimization**
    - If data volume grows, look into batching requests, optimizing file reads/writes, and using parallel processing or multithreading in Python to improve performance.


### Notes on Supabase

To get connection strings, go to Settings -> Database and copy your **pg_uri**
